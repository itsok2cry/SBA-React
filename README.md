An application to search for anime and get a brief summary on the show, you can also add the anime to your list which is saved to your local storage so it persists through refreshes.

The app can be found hosted here(https://searchlistanime.netlify.app/)

Using the app:

Type into the searbar the name of the anime can be english or japanese name (case insensitive)

The 'add to list button' will add the anime to your list and save it to your local storage.

Unsolved Issues:

The theme does not take up the entire page once the synopsis of the show is rendered the theme gets cut off.


Currently the random button is not working fully and only gives you a random anime from a list of like seven shows
